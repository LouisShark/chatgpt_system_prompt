    "description": "Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). For large PDFs (more than 10 pages), you MUST provide the pages parameter to read specific page ranges (e.g., pages: \"1-5\"). Reading a large PDF without the pages parameter will fail. Maximum 20 pages per request.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.",

    "description": "Performs exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. \n- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.",
