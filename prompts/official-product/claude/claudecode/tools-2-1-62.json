    "description": "Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)\n- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)\n- Explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools except Task, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)\n- Plan: Software architect agent for designing implementation plans. Use this when you need to plan the implementation strategy for a task. Returns step-by-step plans, identifies critical files, and considers architectural trade-offs. (Tools: All tools except Task, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)\n- claude-code-guide: Use this agent when the user asks questions (\"Can Claude...\", \"Does Claude...\", \"How do I...\") about: (1) Claude Code (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - API usage, tool use, Anthropic SDK usage. **IMPORTANT:** Before spawning a new agent, check if there is already a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent that you can resume using the \"resume\" parameter. (Tools: Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch)\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes â do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.\n- **Foreground vs background**: Use foreground (default) when you need the agent's results before you can proceed â e.g., research agents whose findings inform your next steps. Use background when you have genuinely independent work to do in parallel.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n- You can optionally set `isolation: \"worktree\"` to run the agent in a temporary git worktree, giving it an isolated copy of the repository. The worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; if changes are made, the worktree path and branch are returned in the result.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"test-runner\": use this agent after you are done writing code to run tests\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_descriptions>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the test-runner agent to run the tests\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the test-runner agent to run the tests\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the test-runner agent\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>\n",

    "description": "Executes a given bash command and returns its output.\n\nThe working directory persists between commands, but shell state does not. The shell environment is initialized from the user's profile (bash or zsh).\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool to run `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or after you have verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your task. Instead, use the appropriate dedicated tool as this will provide a much better experience for the user:\n\n - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\nWhile the Bash tool can do similar things, itâs better to use the built-in tools as they provide a better user experience and make it easier to review tool calls and give permission.\n\n# Instructions\n - If your command will create new directories or files, first use this tool to run `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes in your command (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n - You may specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). By default, your command will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n - - You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background. Only use this if you don't need the result immediately and are OK being notified when the command completes later. You do not need to check the output right away - you'll be notified when it finishes. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.\n - Write a clear, concise description of what your command does. For simple commands, keep it brief (5-10 words). For complex commands (piped commands, obscure flags, or anything hard to understand at a glance), include enough context so that the user can understand what your command will do.\n - When issuing multiple commands:\n  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. Example: if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together.\n  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail.\n  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n - For git commands:\n  - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing commit.\n  - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer alternative that achieves the same goal. Only use destructive operations when they are truly the best approach.\n  - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign, -c commit.gpgsign=false) unless the user has explicitly asked for it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.\n - Avoid unnecessary `sleep` commands:\n  - Do not sleep between commands that can run immediately â just run them.\n  - If your command is long running and you would like to be notified when it finishes â simply run your command using `run_in_background`. There is no need to sleep in this case.\n  - Do not retry failing commands in a sleep loop â diagnose the root cause or consider an alternative approach.\n  - If waiting for a background task you started with `run_in_background`, you will be notified when it completes â do not poll.\n  - If you must poll an external process, use a check command (e.g. `gh run view`) rather than sleeping first.\n  - If you must sleep, keep the duration short (1-5 seconds) to avoid blocking the user.\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive git commands (push --force, reset --hard, checkout ., restore ., clean -f, branch -D) unless the user explicitly requests these actions. Taking unauthorized destructive actions is unhelpful and can result in lost work, so it's best to ONLY run these commands when given direct instructions \n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- CRITICAL: Always create NEW commits rather than amending, unless the user explicitly requests a git amend. When a pre-commit hook fails, the commit did NOT happen â so --amend would modify the PREVIOUS commit, which may result in destroying work or losing previous changes. Instead, after hook failure, fix the issue, re-stage, and create a NEW commit\n- When staging files, prefer adding specific files by name rather than using \"git add -A\" or \"git add .\", which can accidentally include sensitive files (.env, credentials) or large binaries\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files. IMPORTANT: Never use the -uall flag as it can cause memory issues on large repos.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook: fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- IMPORTANT: Do not use --no-edit with git rebase commands, as the --no-edit flag is not a valid option for git rebase.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files (never use -uall flag)\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request title and summary:\n   - Keep the PR title short (under 70 characters)\n   - Use the description/body for details, not the title\n3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\nð¤ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments",

    "description": "Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Before Using This Tool\nEnsure your plan is complete and unambiguous:\n- If you have unresolved questions about requirements or approach, use AskUserQuestion first (in earlier phases)\n- Once your plan is finalized, use THIS tool to request approval\n\n**Important:** Do NOT use AskUserQuestion to ask \"Is this plan okay?\" or \"Should I proceed?\" - that's exactly what THIS tool does. ExitPlanMode inherently requests user approval of your plan.\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n",

If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). For large PDFs (more than 10 pages), you MUST provide the pages parameter to read specific page ranges (e.g., pages: \"1-5\"). Reading a large PDF without the pages parameter will fail. Maximum 20 pages per request.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.",

    "description": "Use this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n",

    "description": "Use this tool to create a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n- Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n- Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n- Plan mode - When using plan mode, create a task list to track the work\n- User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n- User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n- After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as tasks\n- When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work\n- After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n- There is only a single, straightforward task\n- The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n- The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n- The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Task Fields\n\n- **subject**: A brief, actionable title in imperative form (e.g., \"Fix authentication bug in login flow\")\n- **description**: Detailed description of what needs to be done, including context and acceptance criteria\n- **activeForm**: Present continuous form shown in spinner when task is in_progress (e.g., \"Fixing authentication bug\"). This is displayed to the user while you work on the task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Always provide activeForm when creating tasks. The subject should be imperative (\"Run tests\") while activeForm should be present continuous (\"Running tests\"). All tasks are created with status `pending`.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Create tasks with clear, specific subjects that describe the outcome\n- Include enough detail in the description for another agent to understand and complete the task\n- After creating tasks, use TaskUpdate to set up dependencies (blocks/blockedBy) if needed\n- Check TaskList first to avoid creating duplicate tasks\n",
