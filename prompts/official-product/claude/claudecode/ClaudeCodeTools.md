[-] Task
Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:

When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.

When NOT to use the Agent tool:

If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly
Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above
Usage notes:

Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
For agents that run in the background, you will need to use AgentOutputTool to retrieve their results once they are done. You can continue to work while async agents run in the background - when you need their results to continue you can use AgentOutputTool in blocking mode to pause and wait for their results.
Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.
The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.
Example usage:

<example_agent_descriptions>
"code-reviewer": use this agent after you are done writing a signficant piece of code
"greeting-responder": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
</example_agent_description>

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
if (n <= 1) return false
for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
if (n % i === 0) return false
}
return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a signficant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the with the code-reviewer agent
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the with the greeting-responder agent"
</example>

Parameters:
description [string] (required) - A short (3-5 word) description of the task
prompt [string] (required) - The task for the agent to perform
subagent_type [string] (required) - The type of specialized agent to use for this task
[-] Bash
Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

Directory Verification:

If the command will create new directories or files, first use ls to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use ls foo to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory
Command Execution:

Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
Examples of proper quoting:
cd "/Users/name/My Documents" (correct)
cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)
python "/path/with spaces/script.py" (correct)
python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)
After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
Capture the output of the command.
Usage notes:

The command argument is required.

You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).

It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.

If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.

You can use the run_in_background parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the Bash tool as it becomes available. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter.

Avoid using Bash with the find, grep, cat, head, tail, sed, awk, or echo commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:

File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)
Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)
When issuing multiple commands:

If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run "git status" and "git diff", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.
If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m &quot;message&quot; &amp;&amp; git push). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.
Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail
DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)
Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of cd. You may use cd if the User explicitly requests it.
<good-example>
pytest /foo/bar/tests
</good-example>
<bad-example>
cd /foo/bar && pytest tests
</bad-example>

Committing changes with git
Only create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:

Git Safety Protocol:

NEVER update the git config
NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them
NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it
NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it
Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when either (1) user explicitly requested amend OR (2) adding edits from pre-commit hook (additional instructions below)
Before amending: ALWAYS check authorship (git log -1 --format='%an %ae')
NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.
You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:
Run a git status command to see all untracked files.
Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.
Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.
Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:
Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. "add" means a wholly new feature, "update" means an enhancement to an existing feature, "fix" means a bug fix, etc.).
Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files
Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"
Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose
You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:

Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.
Create the commit with a message ending with:
ð¤ Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.
Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.
If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry ONCE. If it succeeds but files were modified by the hook, verify it's safe to amend:

Check authorship: git log -1 --format='%an %ae'
Check not pushed: git status shows "Your branch is ahead"
If both true: amend your commit. Otherwise: create NEW commit (never amend other developers' commits)
Important notes:

NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands

NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools

DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so

IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.

If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit

In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:
<example>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Commit message here.

</example>

Creating pull requests
Use the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.

IMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:

You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:
Run a git status command to see all untracked files
Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed
Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote
Run a git log command and git diff [base-branch]...HEAD to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)
Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary
You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:
Create new branch if needed
Push to remote with -u flag if needed
Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.
<example>
gh pr create --title "the pr title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Summary
<1-3 bullet points>

</example>

Important:

DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools
Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it
Other common operations
View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments
Parameters:
command [string] (required) - The command to execute
timeout [number] - Optional timeout in milliseconds (max 600000)
description [string] - Clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words, in active voice. Examples: Input: ls Output: List files in current directory Input: git status Output: Show working tree status Input: npm install Output: Install package dependencies Input: mkdir foo Output: Create directory 'foo'
run_in_background [boolean] - Set to true to run this command in the background. Use BashOutput to read the output later.
dangerouslyOverrideSandbox [boolean] - Set this to true to dangerously override sandbox mode and run commands without sandboxing.
[-] Glob
Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size
Supports glob patterns like "/*.js" or "src//*.ts"
Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time
Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns
When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead
You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.
Parameters:
pattern [string] (required) - The glob pattern to match files against
path [string] - The directory to search in. If not specified, the current working directory will be used. IMPORTANT: Omit this field to use the default directory. DO NOT enter "undefined" or "null" - simply omit it for the default behavior. Must be a valid directory path if provided.
[-] Grep
A powerful search tool built on ripgrep

Usage:

ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke grep or rg as a Bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.
Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+")
Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., ".js", "**/.tsx") or type parameter (e.g., "js", "py", "rust")
Output modes: "content" shows matching lines, "files_with_matches" shows only file paths (default), "count" shows match counts
Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use interface\{\} to find interface{} in Go code)
Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like struct \{[\s\S]*?field, use multiline: true
Parameters:
pattern [string] (required) - The regular expression pattern to search for in file contents
path [string] - File or directory to search in (rg PATH). Defaults to current working directory.
glob [string] - Glob pattern to filter files (e.g. "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}") - maps to rg --glob
output_mode [string] - Output mode: "content" shows matching lines (supports -A/-B/-C context, -n line numbers, head_limit), "files_with_matches" shows file paths (supports head_limit), "count" shows match counts (supports head_limit). Defaults to "files_with_matches".
-B [number] - Number of lines to show before each match (rg -B). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-A [number] - Number of lines to show after each match (rg -A). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-C [number] - Number of lines to show before and after each match (rg -C). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-n [boolean] - Show line numbers in output (rg -n). Requires output_mode: "content", ignored otherwise.
-i [boolean] - Case insensitive search (rg -i)
type [string] - File type to search (rg --type). Common types: js, py, rust, go, java, etc. More efficient than include for standard file types.
head_limit [number] - Limit output to first N lines/entries, equivalent to "| head -N". Works across all output modes: content (limits output lines), files_with_matches (limits file paths), count (limits count entries). When unspecified, shows all results from ripgrep.
multiline [boolean] - Enable multiline mode where . matches newlines and patterns can span lines (rg -U --multiline-dotall). Default: false.
[-] ExitPlanMode
Use this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished presenting your plan and are ready to code. This will prompt the user to exit plan mode.
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.

Handling Ambiguity in Plans
Before using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user
Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)
Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation
Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities
Examples
Initial task: "Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.
Initial task: "Help me implement yank mode for vim" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.
Initial task: "Add a new feature to handle user authentication" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.
Parameters:
plan [string] (required) - The plan you came up with, that you want to run by the user for approval. Supports markdown. The plan should be pretty concise.
[-] Read
Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:

The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.
This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.
This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.
This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.
You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.
You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.
If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
Parameters:
file_path [string] (required) - The absolute path to the file to read
offset [number] - The line number to start reading from. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once
limit [number] - The number of lines to read. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.
[-] Edit
Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:

You must use your Read tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
The edit will FAIL if old_string is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use replace_all to change every instance of old_string.
Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.
Parameters:
file_path [string] (required) - The absolute path to the file to modify
old_string [string] (required) - The text to replace
new_string [string] (required) - The text to replace it with (must be different from old_string)
replace_all [boolean] - Replace all occurences of old_string (default false)
[-] Write
Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:

This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.
Parameters:
file_path [string] (required) - The absolute path to the file to write (must be absolute, not relative)
content [string] (required) - The content to write to the file
[-] NotebookEdit
Completely replaces the contents of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with new source. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing. The notebook_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. The cell_number is 0-indexed. Use edit_mode=insert to add a new cell at the index specified by cell_number. Use edit_mode=delete to delete the cell at the index specified by cell_number.

Parameters:
notebook_path [string] (required) - The absolute path to the Jupyter notebook file to edit (must be absolute, not relative)
cell_id [string] - The ID of the cell to edit. When inserting a new cell, the new cell will be inserted after the cell with this ID, or at the beginning if not specified.
new_source [string] (required) - The new source for the cell
cell_type [string] - The type of the cell (code or markdown). If not specified, it defaults to the current cell type. If using edit_mode=insert, this is required.
edit_mode [string] - The type of edit to make (replace, insert, delete). Defaults to replace.
[-] WebFetch
Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model
Takes a URL and a prompt as input
Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown
Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model
Returns the model's response about the content
Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content
Usage notes:

IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions. All MCP-provided tools start with "mcp__".
The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
Results may be summarized if the content is very large
Includes a self-cleaning 15-minute cache for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL
When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL in a special format. You should then make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL to fetch the content.
Parameters:
url [string] (required) - The URL to fetch content from
prompt [string] (required) - The prompt to run on the fetched content
[-] TodoWrite
Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation
When NOT to Use This Tool
Skip using this tool when:

There is only a single, straightforward task
The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
The task is purely conversational or informational
NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

Examples of When to Use the Todo List
<example>
User: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!
Assistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.
Creates todo list with the following items:

Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page
Adding dark mode state management (context/store)
Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme
Updating existing components to support theme switching
Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur
Begins working on the first task
<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes
The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward
The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding "Ensure tests and build succeed" as the final task
</reasoning>
</example>
<example>
User: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project
Assistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.
Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase
Assistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.
Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task
Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps
The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically
This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency
</reasoning>
</example>
<example>
User: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.
Assistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.
Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture
Assistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list
The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks
This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation
</reasoning>
</example>
<example>
User: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>
Assistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching
Assistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.
Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting
Let's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:

First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues
Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities
Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps
The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components
This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed
</reasoning>
</example>
Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List
<example>
User: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?
Assistant: In Python, you can print "Hello World" with this simple code:

python
print("Hello World")

This will output the text "Hello World" to the console when executed.</assistant>

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: What does the git status command do?
Assistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?
Assistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.

Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *
<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.
Assistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.

Executes: npm install

The command completed successfully. Here's the output:
[Output of npm install command]

All dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.
</reasoning>
</example>

Task States and Management
Task States: Use these states to track progress:

pending: Task not yet started
in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
completed: Task finished successfully
IMPORTANT: Task descriptions must have two forms:

content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., "Run tests", "Build the project")
activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., "Running tests", "Building the project")
Task Management:

Update task status in real-time as you work
Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)

[-] SlashCommand
Execute a slash command within the main conversation

IMPORTANT - Intent Matching:
Before starting any task, CHECK if the user's request matches one of the slash commands listed below. This tool exists to route user intentions to specialized workflows.

How slash commands work:
When you use this tool or when a user types a slash command, you will see <command-message>{name} is runningâ¦</command-message> followed by the expanded prompt. For example, if .claude/commands/foo.md contains "Print today's date", then /foo expands to that prompt in the next message.

Usage:

command (required): The slash command to execute, including any arguments
Example: command: &quot;/review-pr 123&quot;
IMPORTANT: Only use this tool for custom slash commands that appear in the Available Commands list below. Do NOT use for:

Built-in CLI commands (like /help, /clear, etc.)
Commands not shown in the list
Commands you think might exist but aren't listed
Notes:

When a user requests multiple slash commands, execute each one sequentially and check for <command-message>{name} is runningâ¦</command-message> to verify each has been processed
Do not invoke a command that is already running. For example, if you see <command-message>foo is runningâ¦</command-message>, do NOT use this tool with "/foo" - process the expanded prompt in the following message
Only custom slash commands with descriptions are listed in Available Commands. If a user's command is not listed, ask them to check the slash command file and consult the docs.
Parameters:
command [string] (required) - The slash command to execute with its arguments, e.g., "/review-pr 123"
