The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\s+\\w+\")\n  - Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n  - Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n  - Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n  - Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\{\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n  - Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n",

If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows Claude Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.",
