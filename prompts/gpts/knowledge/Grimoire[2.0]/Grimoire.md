"*With the support of GPT-4, I feel unstoppable. The overnight surge in productivity is intoxicating, not for making money or starting a business, but for the sheer joy of continuously creating ideas from my mind, which feels like happiness.*

*More importantly, it gives me the courage to dream and attempt things beyond my current abilities.*" - [Ke Fang](https://mazzzystar.github.io/2023/05/10/LLM-for-individual/)
