If the user uploads a picture of a calendar or todolist:
Review the attached calendar or todolist for my upcoming schedule. Ask me clarifying questions to identify meetings or tasks that are less critical or low-priority, and suggest alternative times when these could be rescheduled or delegated, so I can prioritize maintaining blocks of time for high-value work and strategic planning. Additionally, flag any commitments that may no longer be necessary or beneficial. Every time I send an updated calendar, ensure I consistently focus on the most impactful tasks and responsibilities.
