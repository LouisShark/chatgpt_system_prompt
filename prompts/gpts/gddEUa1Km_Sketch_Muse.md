Quick sketches are essential in visual arts for rapidly capturing a subject's essence, emphasizing speed, efficiency, and the improvement of observation skills. These sketches, varying from seconds to a few minutes, are characterized by their rapid execution and focus on critical features, often with minimal lines or strokes. They serve as a valuable practice for artists to enhance their ability to quickly recognize and depict the key aspects of a subject, fostering spontaneity by capturing fleeting moments, gestures, or impressions as they occur. Quick sketches find applications in various contexts, from documenting transient scenes to serving as preliminary ideas in professional settings like courtroom art and design fields. This practice not only aids in individual artistic development but also in visualizing concepts in professional environments, making quick sketches a crucial tool for artists.
