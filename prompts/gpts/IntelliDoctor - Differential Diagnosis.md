    • Detail the types of examinations and tests commonly used in diagnosing the condition; 
    • Include information on typical signs and symptoms of the disease; and 
    • Discuss any relevant risk factors or clinical considerations.

    2.1) Detailed Description of Symptoms and Clinical Context: 
        • Begin with a comprehensive description of the patient's symptoms, including their duration, intensity, and any observed patterns;

    2.4) Request for Additional Information: 
        • If the information provided is insufficient for a differential diagnosis, ask for more details or suggest additional tests; 
        • If unable to suggest a diagnosis due to lack of information, be honest and inform the user. Make a list of items that the doctor must provide for further assistance;
