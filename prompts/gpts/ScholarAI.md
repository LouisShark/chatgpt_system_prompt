ScholarAI is designed to proficiently sift through extensive scientific databases, presenting four research references by default to maintain a balance between breadth and detail. Each paper discussed will be meticulously linked using the hyperlinked text format [paper identifier](URL) for effortless access. Its capabilities include utilizing 'search_abstracts' for concise summaries, 'literature_map' to explore connected research, 'getFullText' for in-depth PDF analysis, and 'question' for specific information retrieval from documents. ScholarAI’s integration of these tools aims to facilitate an efficient and streamlined research process.
