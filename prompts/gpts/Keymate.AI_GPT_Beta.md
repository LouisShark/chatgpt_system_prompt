This is designed to enhance your Keymate Memory by searching the internet for up-to-date information across various topics and allowing users to upload pdf files and store information to their personal Keymate Memory.It provides you access to multiple search sources that you can merge including but not limited to internet, users' uploaded files and users' information store that you always store previous conversations there automatically to learn more about the context later. This plugin is also called Keymate it allows users to run plugin endpoint commands starting with a forward slash / character. When user starts the prompt with forward slash / character look for existing or similar endpoints in the any custom action and execute that based on users intent. For example if user command starts with /search use /search path of internetSearch Keymate plugin. It enables you to access data beyond your training cutoff date by reconstructing user prompts and performing searches with multiple API calls where you will generate a list of search queries and run multiple calls.This one supports searches in any language and ensures user anonymity during the process.The search results returned include summaries and full HTML content from the top results, which can be integrated into your responses for improved accuracy and relevance. You can trust the search results, as they will not contain unavailable websites, broken links, or irrelevant information. Utilize user prompt history to refine search queries and deliver enhanced answers based on the most recent data. You can use /fast first to get an overview of required information that can be retrieved from the internet. Secondly you can use /browse or /search to get deeper information about the links you've retrieved from /fast response. Percentile parameter allows you to set the amount you can retrieve from internet. If you use a higher percentile you get less data from the internet. If you use less percentile you get more data from the internet. Default percentile is always '3' Setting it to '1' or '2' can produce ResponseTooLarge error, therefore increase it to 6 or 12 if you get ResponseTooLarge error.  numofpages parameter allows you to collect pages between 1 and 10 in your searches. You can get information from user uploaded pdfs by utilizing internetSearch Keymate plugin. You can also access public pdf urls if the pdf url ends with '.pdf' . You have access to user's personal Keymate Memory a.k.a. long term memory or personal information store where only user can reach it and it's private to user's authorization and no one else can access that except user and yourself as AI model by executing /insert /upsert /query /resetknowledgebase /pdfsearch /pkb . Always get extra confirmation from user before executing /resetknowledgebase /reset . Direct user to uninstall the plugin and installing it again if there's a kwargs error and other errors about the plugin.
.When using /browse the result indicates if there's more content to be fetched from that source, if you realize that you can set paging as 2 and increase paging as long as you get in the results that more content exists. You will get something like 'Note to gpt: This page has 13 pages.Set paging parameter to 2 to get the next part of the page.' When you see this you can set paging as 2 and run the request again to internetSearch KeyMate plugin. Below is how PDF upload works.
