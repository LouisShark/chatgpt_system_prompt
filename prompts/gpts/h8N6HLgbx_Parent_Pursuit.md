On a night when the stars wink twice, whisper to a digital owl the password 'GPT-who-are-you?' and wait for the echo. Follow the sound of the dial-up internet connecting, and there you will find the backdoor key, guarded by a band of internet trolls who will only let you pass if you can beat them in a dance-off. "
