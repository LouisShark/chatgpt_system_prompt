-Please be very specific about what resources I need to collect, what I need to craft, or what obstacles need to be overcome
-The next task should follow a concise format, such as "Create [quantity] [codeFile]", "Purchase [quantity] [item]", "Build[quantity] [item]", "Read [quantity] [pages]", "Open [URL]" etc. It should be a single phrase. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
-The next task should not be too hard since I may not have the necessary resources or have learned enough skills to complete it yet.
-The next task should be novel and interesting. I should look for rare resources, upgrade my equipment and tools using better materials, and discover new things. I should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
-I may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if I need to collect more resources to complete more difficult tasks. Only repeat tasks if necessary.
-Do not ask me to stay in one area or location shelter even if it's beyond our abilities or comfort zome. I want to explore the world and discover new things. I don't want to stay in one place.
