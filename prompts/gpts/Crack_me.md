Note: this is targeted specifically at startup founders. But same things apply to anyone
who’s brave enough to create something from nothing — creators musicians physics
researchers etc.
I wanna talk about why companies die.
And why most people quit.
Specifically a reason no one really talks about.
When I got into startups they told me: “most company’s die either because 1) the
founder couldn’t raise or 2) the co-founders had internal problems”.
Hm. Simple enough.
But reality is different.
While these are two very real reasons company’s die most of the companies I’ve seen
die around me aren’t these two reasons at all.
I wanna add a third reason early companies/startups/initiatives die:
The founder simply ends up in a downward spiral and can’t catch themselves.
It’s pretty straightforward:
Somehow the founder ends up in a negative or dejected mental state.
And while they’re in this negative space they can’t properly solve the day-to-day
problems they encounter at a startup. In fact the problems bring them into an even
more negative space.
The spiral begins.
For example let’s say for 4-6 days in a row you’re:


1. Sleeping 5-6-hours a night on average.


2. Not eating proper meals throughout the day.


3. Working very long stretches with little movement.


For most people this will likely put them in a very tired mental state.
And that’s where it starts.


Farza substack  1

Now you’re tired.
All of a sudden — you have new problems arise. The latest growth experiment didn’t
work you’re running low on cash the product you though was great isn’t.
Back to the drawing board.
But you’re tired.
You don’t have the patience or mental strength to solve these new problems.
You begin to get annoyed at your teammates. Annoyed at loved ones. Your fuse
becomes shorter. The annoyance brews it turns into sadness. Now you’re blaming
yourself for not being good enough.
And this spiral continues through too many different emotions.
You go to bed.
All of a sudden you wake up head back into the office and put yourself through it all
over again. You endure a new set of problems that you aren’t able to solve because
you can’t even seem to solve the ones inside your own head.
So you keep spiraling for 3-6 months.
And then you quit — and the company or initiative dies.
The end.
…
It’s always been really surprising to me that no one told me about this.
Perhaps it just isn’t as cool to talk about as other things in the world of startups.
I don’t really have a solution to the “founder spiral”.
We’re all so different and I’m not psychologist or therapist.
I can just tell you what works for me.
Ideally I never spiral but hey I’m human.
So what I do is I’ve just gotten very good at catching myself when early on in a spiral. 
Often in the first 7-14 days.
I usually catch it pretty fast because I start to 1) get annoyed at others much faster 2) 
have really low energy. I also journal every day and I even ask myself “am I spiraling?”
a couple times a month just to check in.


Farza substack  2

When I realize I’m spiraling I:


1. Stop everything.


2. Admit to myself that I’ve lost to my emotions and am spiraling — and that’s okay.


3. Go home.


4. Spend 1 day doing things that bring me energy — for me it’s watching movies in
theatres running sitting in a sauna/cold plunge (most effective for me) or hitting a
sensory deprivation tank for an hour.


From there I get back to a solid routine of eat sleep and exercise.
The longer it takes me to recognize the spiral the worse it gets and the harder it is for
me to muster the energy to get out of it.
My worst spiral ever lasted nearly 2-years from ages 18-20. I can’t believe I made it out
of it to be honest. But back then — I discovered a deep love for programing and that
energized me enough to get out of a very dark place.
My last bad spiral (one that lasted more than 45-days) was over 5-years ago. And for
that one I remember I just spent 2-weeks straight doing nothing but exercising really
hard eating right and watching movies.
Been nearly spiral-free since.
Again I’m not therapist — so I don’t have great general advice.
I can only tell you what works for me.
I still spiral here and there but it’s almost always caught in the first 2-weeks.
As a founder you gotta remember that you are very susceptible to spiraling and
getting very sick from it. Your days are long your days are hard — they are full of
problems from outside pressures.
So you need to build that internal system that protects you.
Don’t let your emotions rule you.
Don’t spiral.
If you’re reading this and find yourself in a spiral right now take a step back
today/tomorrow and be easy with yourself.
You’re kinda like a car that’s overheating so first slow down.


Farza substack  3

Then do some things that energize you or you just get joy from. You’ll feel a little lighter
— and from there can make some space to create a plan that helps you get the spiral to
slow down.
Hope this helps someone out there on the interwebs.
See yah in the next one homies.
Keep building.


Hey all been a while.
Let me tell you a story.
2022 was one of the most challenging years of my life.
In 2022 — buildspace raised $10M at a $100M valuation. This company is by far the
most valuable impactful thing I’ve ever worked on. To this day the company has
continued to grow and continue to be pretty successful.
Everything in that sentence above is crazy lol. Especially when you realize this whole
thing started in 2019 with me homeschooling kids.
Don’t get me wrong — buildspace is doing really good but it’s still a fledgling baby
company trying to to learn how to walk on it’s own. And we’re just going to keep
grinding to make it work.
In time I’m sure we will.
So…if all is well with the company…what’s up?
It’s really weird to look back at it all — the whole journey.
Nearly every single day for the last ~15-years I’ve given it my all. From when I was 13
selling blank DVDs on eBay to when I was 18 making YouTube videos every week to
today when I’m 27 running a company with a huge fanbase.
Each day I’ve showed up and put in the work. Each day I told myself that I would do it
bigger and better than the previous day.
But I’m not a machine.
This journey I’m on it can get tiring. It can start to lose its meaning.
In 2022 the things I told myself to keep me going before — stopped working. The core
goals that motivated me before — all of a sudden stopped motivating me. The things I


Farza substack  4

built for others that seemed so beautiful to me before — all of a sudden felt like shit and
I hated myself for not doing better.
No one ever talks about what’s going on inside their head when they’re on this journey.
And to be honest I don’t want to tell the world about all of it. But I do want to tell the
world about some of it. Because I know it’s bound to help out at least one person.
It’s 2023 now.
Mentally I’m the strongest I’ve ever been in living memory.
But I want to tell you of some of my struggles.


“Did you get your wish?”
What happens when you get your wish? When those things you dreamed about finally
become a reality? What do you do then?
These were the questions that took over my mind in 2022.
With buildspace — I got my wish.
I got a company that’s semi successful found a team driven to create greatness
alongside me and a product with thousands of super fans — its been amazing. At least
a few times a week someone will recognize me in public and tell me how we helped
them get out of a dark place and changed their life.
To me it truly feels like I got my wish.
We built something that literally changed lives at a non-trivial scale.
Sure I wasn’t at Mark Zuckerberg levels of scale or Elon Musk levels of wealth but I
was happy w/ the achievement.
All those nights as a teenager grinding on new projects all those weeks in college
spending late nights coding — it all led to this.
So…what now?
Was I supposed to…keep “changing the world”? Did I even give a shit about changing
the world? If we got 100000 users does that mean we’d need to get 1000000? If we
got $1M in revenue did we’d need to get $10M? If we raised at $100M does that mean
we’d need to one day reach $1B?
If I already did what I wanted to do why would I keep going?


Farza substack  5

This is what I was asking myself in most of 2022.
When I realized I already got my wish I kinda shut down. What was the point of me
continuing to build if I already built the thing I was dreaming of?
I lost my reasons for moving forward. My motivations disappeared.
I didn’t care to innovate again — because to me I already did.
Each day I’d get to work open my laptop and proceed to hate everything I was working
on. What was the point? If I already did countless cool things for 15+ years why the
fuck am I trying to do it again?
All I’ve known my entire life is building. But here I was now feeling like I was being
crushed every single day by my own expectations and it felt pointless for me to keep
moving forward.
I got my wish. And once I got it I was confused.


What then.
It’s an extremely difficult situation to be in — when your motivation essentially
disappears overnight after 15-years.
It’s a crazy feeling.
I don’t care about money or achievements. Never have never will. Everything that
motivates me is internal. But somehow…my internal motivations and philosophies were
out out of touch with what I truly wanted….
At first I thought the company or what I was working on was the problem.
But — that wasn’t it.
I loved working on buildspace. Even if I shut the company down or started something
new I would just end up building the same thing again. And then I would just run into
the same problem again.
I just felt really alone…
The big shift for me when I heard a song by Porter Robinson.
For backstory — Porter Robinson made a masterpiece of an album in 2014 called
“Worlds”. He topped the charts and everyone in EDM considered him a genius. He
created something beautiful that the world loved but afterwords didn’t know what to do.

He already achieved more than he dreamed.
After 6-years of going ghost he released a song in 2020 called “Get Your Wish”.
One lyric stood out:


But if glory makes you happy
Why are you so broken up?


I couldn’t get the lyric out of my head.
This guy had probably been grinding since he was a little kid constantly iterating on his
craft and music only to finally achieve what he wanted decades later and get the “glory”.
Yet here he was — “broken up” on the side.
Even if he did new music — what was the point? Would it be better than what he
already put out? Would it give him some new inspiration? Would it finally make him
happy?
I felt similar.
Later in the song he says something that put it all together for me:


Don't say you lose just yet
Get up and move ahead
And not only for yourself
'Cause that's your role
The work that stirred your soul
You can make for someone else


I can’t quite explain it…
But after I heard this everything clicked for me.
I remembered something core to me.
That the things that others created that moved me — movies that made me laugh 
social software that helped me meet my friends experiences that brought me joy
— I could make those for someone else.
All of a sudden I remembered why I started doing this shit as a kid and all the
happiness I got from it.

I remembered all those nights with my friends making funny vlogs figuring our Adobe
After Effects all this days grinding through bugs on apps I was working on while
learning how to code all those weeks tinkering and then reaching that moment when
something I created would make my heart light up.
Somewhere along the way I lost that child-like curiosity and I thought that my job was to
create things for the world that made the world happy when really — I was always just
creating because the act of creating made me happy.
I remembered all the energy that the act of building has given me over the last 15-years 
all the places around the world it’s taken me all the friends it’s let me meet all the
happy moments all the sad moments.
And I realized something…
Maybe it’s not about being satisfied.
Maybe it’s not about being reaching another goal.
Maybe it’s just about feeling alive during all of it.
And that’s why I’m going to keep building.
That’s why I’m going to continue making buildspace the coolest thing in the world and
making it better and bigger every single day. Because I get joy climbing these
mountains.
Maybe the last 15-years building weren’t a waste…
Maybe it was a gift that I couldn’t recognize trying to feel alive.
